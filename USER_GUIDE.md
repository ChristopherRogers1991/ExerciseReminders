# User Guide

This guide is a work in progress. Most of the features of the App are
expected to be fairly self explanatory, so for the moment, this will
only cover the non-intuitive features.

## Delete

To delete a an exercise or tag, long-press on it in the list. When you
delete a tag, all the *unique exercises (those with only the selected
tag) will also be deleted.

*At the moment, it is only possible to tag exercises with a single tag,
but in the future, it may be possible to add multiple tags to any
exercise.

## Create a new tag

This is a workaround until the feature is developed.

1) Click the 'ADD EXERCISE' button.
2) Fill in the exercise name.
3) Fill in the tag name. If the tag name does not already
   exist, a new tag will be created.
